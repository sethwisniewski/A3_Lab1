    text: "It’s the turbocharged motoring icon, with more handles to love. The MINI 5 door boasts the same iconic good looks as its 3 door brother, but features an extra pair of passenger doors for practical access to its spacious cabin. And despite its slightly longer frame, the MINI 5 door’s wide, athletic stance and wheels-pushed-out design deliver the corner-carving agility you’d expect from any MINI."
